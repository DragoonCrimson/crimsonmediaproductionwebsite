			<h3 class="SubHeader">Experience</h3>
		I started coding in early 2022, having decided that I would like to adventure into new and interesting challenges within the field of Information Technology, starting with deciding to make a financial application through the use of Python, but encountering some issues with porting it to other computers. This made me look for a solution, that solution became C++, from there I found other issues. Hence the long journey into learning as many languages as possible. I would not say my fluency in these languages is "Expert" but I have a good grasp of each language, its usage and implementations in day to day uses.

      Throughout my life I have been interested in computer games, originally it started off just enjoying the pleasure of gaming, which then involved into a curiousity of "How do they do this", the they being game developers. This journey lead me into looking at game development courses online and through them and books I managed to work my way around Unity Engine and Unreal Engine 4 and Unreal Engine 5. Currently looking into creating a game with some friends via the Unreal Engine 5.
