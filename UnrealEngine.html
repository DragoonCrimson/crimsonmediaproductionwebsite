  <h3 class="SubHeader">What Applications Does UE Have?</h3>
  <p>Unreal Engine 5 is the most recent version of UE, it lead into some state of the art pieces of software in multiple industries, one of which being TwinMotion, this allows for real time rendering and creation of 3D environments.
    TwinMotion is available for an unlimited period of time on a trial, but is also available to purchase: See link for more details -> <a href="https://www.twinmotion.com/en-US">TwinMotion</a><br><br>MetaHuman is also another cool application made by Epic, it also uses UE5, this is used to create realistic looking 3D humans, these can be freely ported from MetaHuman to both UE5 Game Engine and TwinMotion, as well as available for usage in some animation suites.</p>
</div>
<div class="Column">
  <h3>How We Use UE5</h3>
  <p>We at Crimson Media Productions use UE5 for a range of projects that are currently in-house, one of which is due for publication, an HD endless runner in a similar vain to Subway Surfers, and many more of its ilk. We also use both TwinMotion and MetaHuman in our projects, enabling consistent quality throughout our projects. We are aiming to get the money to have the full commercial license for TwinMotion and thus due to the agreement, TwinMotion cannot be used under commercial projects without the full license agreement.</p>
